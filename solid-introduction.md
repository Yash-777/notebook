Introduction to SOLID
=====================

SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for the five basic principles of object-oriented programming. The principles, when applied together, intend to make it more likely that a programmer will create a system that is easy to maintain and extend over time.

## Single Responsibility Principle ##

*A class should have only a single responsibility*

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle

## Open/Closed Principle ##

*Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification*

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle

## Liskov Substitution Principle ##

*Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program*

## Interface Segregation Principle ##

*Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface*

## Dependency Inversion Principle ##

*One should depend on abstractions; do not depend on concretions*
