Node.js and Express Application Setup
=====================================

Node.js® is a platform built on [Chrome's JavaScript runtime](https://code.google.com/p/v8/) for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an [event-driven](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/node-js-event-loop/), [non-blocking I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O) model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

The following steps will walk you through setting up a Node.js and Express application development environment. Unless otherwise noted, no specific tools or IDEs are required.

### Steps ###

1. [Install Node.js](#install-node.js)
2. Install Express
3. [Generate Express Application](#generate-an-express-application)
4. Configure Express Application
5. Include static resources
6. Running and Monitoring
7. Deploying Node/Express Applications

# Install Node.js #

Go to the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) website and download the latest version, or go to the [downloads](https://nodejs.org/download/) section to download older versions. The most current available version at the time of this writing is 0.12.7.

> On Windows, Node will install by default in your `Program Files` directory. To avoid needing administrative privileges to make any modifications to Node, I prefer to install it into an apps folder I crated off my root, such as `C:\apps\nodejs\[version]`. Ultimately, the next step makes is so that it doesn't matter where you install it.

### What about npm? ###

**npm** is a package manager used by the Node ecosystem. A version of it will be installed along with Node, so you don't need to worry about installing it separately.

### Add Node To Your Path ###

>The installation package *might* have already done this for you.

In order to make the `node` and `npm` CLI available on the Windows command line, you'll want to add the Node installation directory to your systems `PATH` environment variable. While the exact steps to do this will vary depending on the version of Windows you are using, ultimately you want to open the **System Properties** dialog box to the **Advanced** tab and click on the **Environment Variables** button on the bottom.

>Directories in the `PATH` are separated by the semicolon (;), with **no** trailing semicolon at the end.

# Install Express #

With Node and npm installed, you can now create an Express application. Start by installing the application generator tool, `express`, globally via npm.

```
$ npm install express-generator -g
``` 

Once installed, you can see all the command line options available using the `-h` option:

```
$ express -h

  Usage: express [options] [dir]

  Options:

    -h, --help          output usage information
    -V, --version       output the version number
    -e, --ejs           add ejs engine support (defaults to jade)
        --hbs           add handlebars engine support
    -H, --hogan         add hogan.js engine support
    -c, --css <engine>  add stylesheet <engine> support (less|stylus|compass|sass) (defaults to plain css)
        --git           add .gitignore
    -f, --force         force on non-empty directory
```

# Generate An Express Application #

Use the express application generator to create a skeleton express application. As the app structure generated by the generator is just one of the multiple ways of structuring Express apps, we should feel free to not use it or to modify it to best suit our needs.

Start by navigating to the directory you want to contain your application and run the command:

```
$ express myapp
```

The generated app directory structure will look like this:

```
.
├── app.js
├── bin
│   └── www
├── package.json
├── public
│   ├── images
│   ├── javascripts
│   └── stylesheets
│       └── style.css
├── routes
│   ├── index.js
│   └── users.js
└── views
    ├── error.jade
    ├── index.jade
    └── layout.jade
```

For the purposes of our customization, take the following steps:

1. Move `www` out of the `bin` folder and into the root folder
2. Rename `www` to `server.js`
3. Delete the (now empty) `bin` folder
4. Create a folder named `app`
5. Move the folders `routes` and `views` into the `app` folder
6. Create the folders `config`, `controlers` and `models` in the `app` folder
7. Rename `app.js` to `express.js`, and move it into the `.\app\config` folder
