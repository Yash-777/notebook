### Basics of Computer Programming ###

**Composition Over Inheritance**

Prefer composition over inheritance as it is more malleable (easy to modify later), but do not use a compose-always approach. With composition, it's easy to change behavior on the fly with Dependency Injection/Setters. Inheritance is more rigid as most languages do not allow you to derive from more than one type.

- Inheritance: Does TypeB want to expose the complete interface (all public methods no less) of TypeA such that TypeB can be used where TypeA is expected? *A Cessna biplane will expose the complete interface of an airplane, if not more. So that makes it fit to derive from Airplane.*

- Composition: Does TypeB only want only some/part of the behavior exposed by TypeA? *A Bird may need only the fly behavior of an Airplane. In this case, it makes sense to extract it out as an interface/class/both and make it a member of both classes.*
